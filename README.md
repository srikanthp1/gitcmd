# Image classification

 * we are training our model on MNIST dataset. 
 * we are using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. 
 * Implemented in pytorch 

## Info

[![Python 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
[torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) 0.8
Uses [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  for ploting accuracy and losses.

## Getting Started

To install **PyTorch**, see installation instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

The instructions to install PyTorch should also detail how to install **torchvision** but can also be installed via:

``` bash
pip install torchvision
```


## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikanthp1/era5.git
```

## Demo 

[**CustomNetwork**](https://github.com/srikanthp1/era5/blob/main/S5.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/srikanthp1/era5/blob/main/S5.ipynb)

* we have the following:
 ⋅⋅1. load datasets 
 ⋅⋅2. augment data
 ⋅⋅3. define a custom CNN
 ⋅⋅4. train a model
 ⋅⋅5. view the outputs of our model
 ⋅⋅6. visualize the model's representations
 ⋅⋅7. view the loss and accuracy of the model. 

* **transforms** for trainset and testset are in utils.py. 
* you will also find **dataloaders** in __utils.py__. 
* **train** and **test** functions are written in __utils.py__.
* model is written in __model.py__.
* dataset is downloaded in __S5.ipynb__ file as we may want to try new datasets. 
* transforms if needed to be added or modified refer __utils.py__.
* visualization of dataset is in __S5.ipynb__  
* __graphs__ for loss and accuracy is added after training and testing is done


## Model details

```python
model = Net().to(device)
summary(model, input_size=(1, 28, 28))
```
